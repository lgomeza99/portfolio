#### Clustering Model for Fraudulent Transaction Identification
Developed a clustering model to identify fraudulent transactions on a digital investment platform. The project's goal was to segment types of transactions based on their characteristics and identify common variables in fraudulent transactions. The first step involved building the database using SQL, where important transaction characteristics were grouped, such as amounts, banks, times, frequency, customer characteristics, and more. Data cleaning was done in Python using Pandas, where records with missing information were found that were not necessarily errors but represented default values for certain columns. After necessary corrections, the resulting dataset included 84,392 non-fraudulent transactions, 1,608 suspicious transactions, and 13 confirmed fraudulent transactions. 

#### Stock Price Prediction Model Based on Neural Networks
This project involved developing a multivariate Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict stock prices. The model utilized various market indicators and historical stock data, such as opening/closing prices, trading volume, and macroeconomic factors, to capture temporal dependencies and complex relationships between these variables. The RNN's sequential processing capabilities allowed it to forecast future stock prices more accurately by leveraging patterns from multiple features over time. This approach provided a comprehensive tool for investment decision-making and stock price trend analysis.

#### Churn Prediction Model for Customer Retention
This project involved developing a Machine Learning model to predict customer churn in a fintech platform. The model aimed to classify customers based on their likelihood of leaving the platform, using various customer behavior and transaction data. Key features included usage frequency, transaction amounts, interaction with customer support, and product engagement. The model utilized algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to achieve high accuracy. By identifying at-risk customers, the model provided actionable insights for customer retention strategies, enabling the business to proactively engage and reduce churn rates.
